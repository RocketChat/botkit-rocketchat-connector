# botkit-rocketchat-connector
A Botkit platform connector for Rocket.Chat

This is a work in progress for the two communities to collaborate on to achieve the integration proposed in this issue on the main Rocket.Chat project: https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/9937

We will follow the guide here https://botkit.ai/docs/howto/build_connector.html to create a module that can be required by Botkit bots as a controller for Rocket.Chat. The outcome will be something like the current Slack integration, which is packaged with Botkit, here: https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/lib/SlackBot.js

This work will pair with another project to provide a starter bot, implimenting this connector. The starter bot will provide most of the documentation. e.g Similar to https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack

When complete, this readme should be replaced with any specific configuration and usage information for the connector.

It may also end up being moved to be maintained under the [howdyai](https://github.com/howdyai) organisation, depending on what makes sense for the contributors doing most of the maintenance.
